GreenHabit is a waste tracking and management application designed to help users reduce their environmental impact by monitoring and managing their waste production. On average, a family of four generates approximately 6,400 pounds (2,900 kilograms) of trash per year, contributing to ocean and air pollution and global warming. Recycling, composting, and responsible waste management are essential practices to mitigate these issues.

## Features

- **User Accounts**: Users can create accounts within the app, providing them with a personalized eco-friendly experience.
- **Waste Tracking**: Users can input and monitor the amount and type of garbage they dispose of over specific periods, whether it's daily, monthly, or custom intervals.
- **Leaderboard**: GreenHabit features a leaderboard that allows users to compare their eco-friendliness with others. Users can see how they stack up against peers in terms of waste reduction.
- **Progress Evaluation**: Users can assess their waste reduction progress by comparing their current waste output with data from previous months or days. This feature empowers users to make more informed, eco-conscious choices.
